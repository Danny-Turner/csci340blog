# Introduction

I just finished setting up this blog. The process was fairly involved but the [instructions](http://mark.goadrich.com/courses/csci340f19/labs/lab3.html) for the lab were very straight forward.  Hopefully as the course progresses I will actually understand what I just did.

For the time being I think that we used [Ruby] (https://rubyinstaller.org/) run Jekyll. This course is exposing me to lots of different pieces of software, but I have barely been able to scratch the surface of most of them.

So far we have briefly looked at:
- HTML
- CSS
- Boostrap
- Ruby
- Jekyll

I'm looking forward to spending more time gaining a better understand of all of these as the course goes on. The [Markdown Cheat Sheet] (https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) gives a nice quick overview of the syntax needed to make this page.
