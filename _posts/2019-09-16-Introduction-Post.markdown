# First Post
I just finished setting up this blog. The process was fairly involved, but the [instructions](http://mark.goadrich.com/courses/csci340f19/labs/lab3.html) for the lab were very straight forward.  Hopefully as the course progresses I will actually understand what I just did.

For the time being I believe we used [Ruby](https://rubyinstaller.org/) to run Jekyll. This course is exposing me to lots of different pieces of software, but we have barely  scratched the surface of most of them.

So far we have briefly looked at:
- HTML
- CSS
- Boostrap
- Ruby
- Jekyll

I'm looking forward to spending more time gaining a deeper understanding of all of these as the course goes on. The [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) gives a nice quick overview of the syntax needed to make this page.
