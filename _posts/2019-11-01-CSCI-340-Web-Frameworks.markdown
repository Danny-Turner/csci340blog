We have now seen all six of the framework presentations in class. I was on the Laravel team. I had some difficulty installing Laravel, but once it was installed the video tutorials did a good job of explaining how to use it.

##### Django
This framework uses Python. Several team members had difficulty installing it, but it seems to be easy to learn and well documented. Django is a fairly complete framework and has built in support for most features we might want to implement.

##### Ruby on Rails
This framework uses the Ruby programming language. It is a pretty complete framework and has built in support for most features we might need to use in our project. It has some similarities to Laravel in that it uses a migration system for databases and it uses Model-View-Controller architecture.

##### ASP.net
This framework uses C#. It seems to be a very popular framework. Installation was very straight forward. It has a nice GUI (Visual Studio) for working on projects and has built in support for any feature we would want to use in our project. It also uses database migrations and Model-View-Controller architecture.

##### Flask
This framework uses Python. Flask is a very minimal framework and does not include built in support for databases. Since we will use databases in our projects this does not seem like a strong option.

##### Express
This framework uses javascript. Flask is another minimal framework with no built in support for databases.
